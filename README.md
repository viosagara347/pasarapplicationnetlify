> -   `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
> -   `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
> -   `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
> -   `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory
>
> You must have npm installed globally in order to use this build environment. _( **viosagara347 edits** Built using node v12.16.2 and the Gulp CLI v2.2.0 > Local v4.0.2 )_. If Gulp is not running properly after running `npm install`, you may need to update node and/or the Gulp CLI locally.
